You are also expected to use the same libraries used in the first lab session. You are allowed to use and modify the `helper` functions we provided in the first lab session or create your own. Also, be aware that the helper functions may need modification as you are dealing with a completely different dataset. This part is worth 80% of your grade!\n",
